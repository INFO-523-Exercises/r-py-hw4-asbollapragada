Repository for HW 04 from the course: INFO 523 - Data Mining and Discovery taught by Dr. Greg Chism

## Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository to:
   
   #### If Using R:
   - An RStudio Project (If using R)
   - A Project within [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)

   #### If Using Python: 
   - A VSCode directory
   - A Google Collab project
   
### 2. Go to the web page for the exercise:
   If Using R: found [here](https://datamineaz.org/slides/week8/rexercise4.2).
   If Using Python: found [here](https://datamineaz.org/python/regressionpython)
   
### 3. Reproduce the exercise in a new Quarto Document or Jupyter Notebook with a novel dataset from the [tidytuesday repository 2023 datasets](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023)
  - Hint: Quarto can render a document into a Jupyter Notebook. I recommend just using Quarto unless you're using Google Collab. See tutorial documentation on available formats [here]([https://posit.cloud/](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html)https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html).

#### Suggested datasets & question:
